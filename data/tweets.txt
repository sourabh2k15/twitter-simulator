I just sat in awe at how beautiful Harvard was and how amazing it was to have a group of Christians in the school

You are a fucking bitch and I think I may hate you even more than I hate Paris Hilton

Because nothing says  I really really love Angelina Jolie  like making it publicly clear that your marriage to her hinges on whether or not the closeminded among us suddenly open their minds
I think Angelina Jolie is so much more beautiful than Jennifer Anniston who by the way is majorly OVERRATED
GEICO is a GREAT ride

When I saw the letter that said  people applied I no longer feel so crappy about the Harvard thing
When Emmy was in town I told her  in a moment of pure physical pain as we hiked up to the Lombard  Leavenworth intersection  that San Francisco is always halfway between fantastic and miserable
Personally I blame Angelina Jolie a psychologicallydamaged attentionseeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexuallyinteresting noncomformist wildchild
Uh III hear the Paris Hilton is very beautiful
By the time I left the Hospital I had no time to drive to Bostonwhich sucked because 
either or not too big though I think Angelina Jolies are unattractive
 The guy with the  Y  on his shirt says  Oh yeah well Harvard really sucks
Lol the other day this super ugly fat girl who i have never even talked to before said i looked like a paris hilton wannabe i was like wow thanks i love paris hilton

The citizens and government of San Francisco are still stupid but at least they can legally defend themselves
Personally I blame Angelina Jolie a psychologicallydamaged attentionseeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexuallyinteresting noncomformist wildchild
 San Francisco prohibits kerchoo powders and stink balls
Ive been working on an article and Antid Oto has been er so upset about the shitty Harvard plagiarizer that he hasnt been able to even look at keyboards

I LOVE San Francisco it is one of my favorite cities
